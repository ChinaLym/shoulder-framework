# üìñIntroduction [‰∏≠Êñá language](README_zh.md)

`Shoulder Framework` is a Java WEB framework based on `Spring Boot`, featuring built-in elegant functionalities, which aims to lower the
cost of coding and enhance the happiness of WEB development.

- **See DEMO IN
  **Ôºö  [GitHub](https://github.com/ChinaLym/shoulder-framework-demo)„ÄÅ[Gitee](https://gitee.com/ChinaLym/shoulder-framework-demo)

### Compared with `Spring Boot`

`Shoulder Framework` is a plugin for `Spring Boot`, integrating *
*[the best practices of elegant software design and development](https://spec.itlym.cn)** with enhanced functionalities.

It proves to be more efficient in the following scenarios!

- Scenarios such as `graduation projects`, `outsourced projects`, etc.: Quickly access some common functionalities (AOP auto logging, AOP
  exception handling, low SQL, WEB security, embedded DB/Redis, multi-language, etc.), accelerating development!
- For developing a `microservice base framework`: Many companies/organizations usually have some unified coding standards. `Shoulder`
  implements the repetitive parts of this work (jar package design, compilation, distribution, modularization, providing default
  implementation, etc.). Secondary development based on `Shoulder` will significantly reduce the difficulty of implementation.
- For `internal framework development`: Based on `Shoulder` for secondary development of the basic jar in the
  company/organization: `Shoulder`'s implementation of standards is similar to `Spring Boot` and is `extendable`. It can be very convenient
  for extension and secondary development.

# üöÄ Quick Start

## Start with a Demo

Through the simple in **[demo projects](https://github.com/ChinaLym/shoulder-framework-demo/tree/master/demo1)
** / ([github](https://github.com/ChinaLym/shoulder-framework-demo/tree/master/demo1), [gitee](https://gitee.com/ChinaLym/shoulder-framework-demo/tree/master/demo1)),
feel the elegant coding experience brought by `Shoulder`.

## Using in an existing `Spring-Boot` project

Just add the module you want to use, for instance, if you want to use `shoulder-web's dynamic dictionary ability`, simply include the
corresponding starter:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>cn.itlym</groupId>
    <artifactId>shoulder-starter-web</artifactId>
    <version>0.8</version>
</dependency>
```

## Create a Shoulder project via `maven-archetype`

`Shoulder` provides a [maven archetype](https://github.com/ChinaLym/shoulder-framework/tree/master/shoulder-archetype-simple) to quickly
create projects. Just ensure you have `JDK17+` and `Maven` installed locally.

1. Open terminal.
2. Run the following command to generate a new Shoulder project:

```shell
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=cn.itlym \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=shoulder-archetype-simple \
  -DarchetypeVersion=0.8 \
  -DgroupId=com.yourcompany \
  -DartifactId=yourappName \
  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

## Manually creating a new project

Just use the following `pom.xml` directly, the only difference from a Spring Boot project is the difference `<parent>` of `pom.xml.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <!-- for global version control. include spring-boot-parent -->
    <parent>
        <groupId>cn.itlym</groupId>
        <artifactId>shoulder-parent</artifactId>
        <version>0.8</version><!-- shoulder-version -->
    </parent>

    <groupId>com.demo</groupId><!-- your groupId -->
    <artifactId>hello-shoulder</artifactId><!-- your artifactId -->
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version><!-- your version -->

    <dependencies>
        <!-- add module with version tag like using spring-boot-starter -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>cn.itlym</groupId>
            <artifactId>shoulder-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

</project>

```

# ‚úà Planning & Development Roadmap

`Shoulder` aims to be a complete re-usable platform (PaaS), where users only need to focus on their business logic. Here is the overall
outlook:

- `Shoulder iPaaS` iPaaS Basic middleware environment: Shoulder offers dependency middleware Docker images or deployment guides (e.g.,
  databases, message queues, service registration centers, task scheduling centers, search engines, alarm and monitoring systems, etc.).
- `Shoulder Specific` manuel of development, see **[the best practices of elegant software design and development](https://spec.itlym.cn)**
- **Shoulder Framework**  This project, aims to encapsulation of common capabilities, reducing code redundancy and lowering system
  development and maintenance costs.
- `Shoulder Platform` General business platform, provides user platform, payment platform, notification center, business gateway, data
  dictionary, global ID generator, and other basic, common business capabilities.
- `Shoulder Platform SDK` Provides SDKs to facilitate business layer integration.
